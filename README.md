meteor-stubs
============

Stubs for unit testing meteor with any testing framework.

### Installation

- To keep Meteor from running your tests on the server, you will need a structure similar to this:
    - app (your Meteor app)
    - tests (your unit tests)
- From the root level, install the stubs:

```bash
npm install meteor-stubs
```
